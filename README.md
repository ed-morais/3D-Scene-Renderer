# 3D-Scene-Renderer

A 3D scene visualization exercise for Computer Graphics course at UESPI (Universidade Estadual do Piau√≠)

## Description

This project demonstrates fundamental 3D graphics concepts using Three.js. It creates a simple scene with three basic geometric shapes: a textured cube, a colored sphere, and a blue cylinder.

## Features

- Three 3D objects with different materials and positions
- Basic camera controls for scene navigation
- Multiple light sources (ambient, directional, point)
- Object transformations (rotation, scaling)
- Responsive design

## Technologies

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- Three.js

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Open index.html in a web browser

No additional installation required as the Three.js library is loaded via CDN.

## Usage

**Camera Controls:**
- W/S: Move forward/backward
- A/D: Move left/right
- Q/E: Move up/down

**Object Controls:**
- Spacebar: Toggle object rotation
